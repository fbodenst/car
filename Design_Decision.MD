# Why junction box between battery modules and BMW
Because without a junction box you’d end up with:
* lots of inline splices floating around,
* no strain relief,
* and a messy shared return splice somewhere random.

The junction box gives you one clean “transition node”


# Overall electrical safety
* we need to decide where to put the fuse - potentially in between bms voltage connector 1 and 2 (so grp 3 and 4)
* we might want to add 2 service disconnects to make the battery really safe by keeping battery voltage below 60V while working on it
* we need to add bat output relay
