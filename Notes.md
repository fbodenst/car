* maybe switch fully to AEM ecosystem - but then i would loose the IMD monitoring from Orion - also AEM fully supports Orion as it seems
* so maybe stick with it but check out the PDU modules and dashboard
* Platine für LV Verkabelung muss entwickelt werden - Sicherheits-Relais + Sicherungen (Junction Box)
* LV-Stecker
