# HV Battery Connector 
* Current rating > 400A - we could go lower but maybe sth for a V2
* HV Cable - we will go with 95mm2 - at 400A this is a good compromise vs. 120mm2. Other option would be 70mm2 (options given by the plug manufacturers)
* We go woth Amphenol connectors and A coding - A coded connectors will only mate with A coded plugs

# MSD - Manual service disconnect
* We will go with an integrated solution where the plug has a 400A integrated fuse
